# Data_Science_001
A collection of Python Scripts used for DataScience, using Jupyter, etc

In Data Science:

1. You usually start with a question to answer -> a problem to solve
2. You wrangle data -> data acquisition/ data cleaning
3. You explore data -> build intuition, find patterns
4. Make conclusions and predicitions (using machine learning, etc)
5. You communicate your findings (whether through a blog or through visualization).
  1. Data visualization is useful for communication

You may need to return to your original question and refine it -> scientific process
1. create hypothesis, use empiricism to observe, make a conclusion
2. Sometimes not necessarily in order -> sometimes data acquisition happens before question to ask.
